Whizz is a social media messaging web application which allows users to interact andshare text messages, images and much more.
As more and more people are becoming accustomed to sites like Facebook and Twitter, the demand for social features is on the rise. 
People want to be able to communicate with one another, share content easily and feel as if they are a part of the content they
are consuming. It is a Real-time Chatting Application which we developed using React, Node.js,Express.js, Firebase for easier and faster development of WHIZZ Application.
Each of these technology provides an end to end framework to work in. React is a JavaScript framework that is used for building frontend. 
Node.js provides users to run their code on the server. The Firebase Realtime Database is a cloud-hosted NOSQL database that lets you store and sync data between your users in
realtime.

Note :
Still Project is not implemented completely. Any Suggestions will be accepted. Thank You...
